  <p><strong>Time: 5:00 till late!!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Place: Kabana Club Kacyiru </strong></p>

<p>Hey beautiful people. First of all let me just take this time and Thank Everybody who really supported me since when I started this journey of photography especially. My family and Everybody concerning Facebook friends,those who follow me on different social media accounts..I know they’re many I’ve never talked to but showed Love to my work and supported as well and really you should all know you’re all amazing people. Cause its too hard to see amazing and helping people that shows Love like y’all do.</p>

<p>I’m happy and glad to Invite all of you in my First photography solo Exhibition . Which will take place on 9th September to 16th September 2016 at kabana club near Hotel umubano or Next umubano hotel(Novotel) Left side.
My Exhibition will be based on the cycle of of the Love of a Mother to her child And the Love of the child towards his oe her mother..In other words love of A mother to his son or Daughter .</p>

<p>The story behind every single picture I will exhibit in this coming Exhibition will be inspired my Mother Mukantagwabira Marie Chantal</p>

<p>Lot of people Asked me why I titled my Exhibition From umbilical cord (Photography Exhibition ) by Davidberg Murenzi
Actually I titled This exhibition” Umbilical cord “is because before you get to live on earth the umbilical cord feeds you and keeps that connection between a mother and his or her child till when she gives birth as she tries hard on feeding,eating and standing on her as the umbilical cord feeds you… Mothers Love is something you can’t compare to anything,It grows in you and as she takes good care of you,that makes you feel loved…There’s really no greater heaven than the heart of a Loving mother.
Mothers are Everything!..</p>
