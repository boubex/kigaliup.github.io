<p>Allie (Alexandra) and Carolyn are teaming up this Saturday to offer lots of hands on instruction in this 3-hour workshop. Acro Yoga is a yogic approach to partner acrobatics in which we learn to safely lift one another. Who’s ready to fly?!</p>

<p>Beginners and those with some experience are all welcome. 8000 RWF per person. We will provide mats and drinking water. No need to register in advance, just show up ready to try something completely new :)</p>

<p>we will practice in groups of 2, 3 and 4 people swtiching partners as we go so please don’t worry about coming with a partner. Young adults are welcome too! ((If you are interested in acro yoga for kids and parents, please send us a message, we have another group for that))</p>

<p>The workshop will be held at our Kichukiro location. Directions and a map to this location are available on our website https://www.yegoyogarwanda.com/</p>
