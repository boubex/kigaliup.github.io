In today’s ever-dynamic world, branding is taking an all new shape.
Our one day of hands on branding will focus on:

- Defining your brand?
- How to grow your brand culture to give a lasting impression

This workshop’s intention is not to teach you about design or branding for that matter, more about helping put the dots together to better define the does and don’t of branding.

Lycamedia is offering pro-bono consulting for those who register latest the 20th. Only four spots will be available for this, so first come first served.
