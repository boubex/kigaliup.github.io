A music festival in Kigali featuring world music, reggae, funk, blues, hip hop and roots artists from around the globe.


KigaliUp’s musical palette embraced Rwanda’s three ancient musical expressions: Batwa Intwatwa songs, rhythmic Bahutu soundscapes and Batutsi pastoral melodies, plus other sounds birthed from Africa’s deep, diverse musical traditions - world music, folk, blues, hip hop, funk, gospel and reggae. KigaliUp! gave Rwandan music a new, central platform, and its musicians fresh exposure to international performers and new sounds and performance approaches. 

KigaliUp helps celebrate Rwanda as an economic and social success story that brings people to see the mountain gorillas, beautiful landscape, artisan markets, villages and lakes.
