Expected outcome:
Follow the meal plan and the workout and lose up to 10-15 kg of body fat and gain up to 5% muscle. If you follow the training program, you WILL get in insane shape.

1. Sign up as a team of 2.
2. Each team has to be at WAKA Fitness on the 1st of September at 6 PM for the initial weigh-in and for the before pictures.
3. Every week each team has to measure their results at WAKA Fitness and send the results to WAKA Fitness.
