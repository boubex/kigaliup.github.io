Muscathlon in Rwanda!

We fight for justice by running, walking, cycling or climbing!
Discover the country with the 1000 mountains, and get children away from extreme poverty. Join us in the fight for justice!

Muskathlon is the ultimate endurance test. You choose to go, ride or run for children living in extreme poverty. You decide on which activity you want to participate, but you will need to collect either 10 sponsors for 10 grandchildren, or 100,000, to reach your goal. Do you take the challenge?

Muskathlon in Rwanda is arranged 12-19. May 2017 in Kigali, Rwanda. 4M organizes Muskathlon in collaboration with Compassion. Compassion is a worldwide sponsorship organization that helps children out of extreme poverty. Read more at www.compassion.no.

The History of Rwanda Muskathlon
In 1994, the Hutu militia estimated an estimated 800,000 Rwanda citizens from the Tutsi tribe. This happened in 100 days. By using machete or other different brutal ways to kill, they slaughtered the population. The ruling president, Paul Kagama, liberated the country from these murders, by leading his Tutsi army to gain power in the country. Since 1994, Kagame has been ruling in the country, and many reconciliation projects have taken place. This has led the country to a place where it is now relatively quiet. But there are still trauma and scars everywhere. Compassion focuses on helping the leading new generations of children to be able to lead their country to a future of peace, brotherhood and prosperity.
Attending Rwanda will give you a unique insight into one of the most important and worst tragedies of our present generation. You can make a difference.
