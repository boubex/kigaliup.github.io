Since Abigaelle Closet was Created, it's goal is to be a voice, empower communities and be the hope to the hopeless. The goal of our second project is to make women in Mahama Camp less dependent. We are going to work with Sacode and have them teach the women how to make their own pads. They shouldn't use used clothes during their periods nor shouldn't they depend on anyone when it's about pads.
As they will become independent, they can use what they will learn from Sacode either to start a business or rediscover some hidden talents within.

We have also thought of young jobless refugees in Kigali with business ideas but no capital to make it happen.
We will be providing a small capital to a group of young jobless refugees and some members from AC will mentor them .

This fun night will not only contribute to your entertainement but it will also help change lives bringing a much needed light in hearts that are darkened.

Join us for a night of Art, haute couture, amazing styles but mostly a night of Love and Compassion
