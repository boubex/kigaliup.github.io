Root Foundation Rwanda is a local NGO in Kagugu and was founded 2012 to bring street kids back to school. 

On the 24th July we are going to make a big event to raise awareness for all Rwandan street kids. On this day we take our love and spirit to make the street kids of Nyamirambo happy. In the morning they are going to participate in a professional dance workshop. 

In the afternoon you will see them performing as well as the kids of Esperance, Club Rafiki and Root Foundation Rwanda. As a big highlight African Calabash Group is going to show off some of their actual songs. 

If you are interested you can also donate some clothes for the street kids of Nyamirambo in advance. Just call: + 0726 689 703
for more informations. These kids have a really vulnerable background. Some of them are living on the streets since years and they are struggeling day by day. Mostly they are sniffing clue to forget their hunger and usually they are not sleeping in the night.

Come, celebrate with us and show your AWARENESS FOR RWANDAN STREET KIDS. 24th JULY, 3 PM @ ESPERANCE, KIMISAGARA.
