Join us on our first SOCENT Happy Hour as we begin our second year hosting and engaging social enterprises in Kigali.

One Acre Fund our partner, a non-profit organisation supplies smallholder farmers in East Africa with financing and training to reduce hunger and poverty, is offering free drinks to the first 100 people to come through the doors.

See you soon and tag a friend that would benefit from the networking on this evening.
