THE ANTICIPATED RAYS - Solo Exhibition by Moses Izabiriza

Story of life style in refugee camp

November 2015, Izabiriza Moses visited Kiziba refugee camp in Western province of Rwanda, Moses spent a lot of time with Children with their mothers , trying to learn more from their life style in the Camp and Moses had to talk to different people in the Camp.

â€œ Who knows tomorrow? Who prepared Yesterday, what gives you hope? Moses inspired by different stories from this Refugee Camp (Children and Women) and for his experience He started to create some Paintings to share his experience of life style in Refugee Camp.

When we become Refugees we loose Hope, love, Freedom and Our Community displaced. When life changed we loose our families, we loose our Humanity and you see that World is not yours.
In His Project, Moses is showing different Perspective of everyday life and Hope of Refugees for their Future.
