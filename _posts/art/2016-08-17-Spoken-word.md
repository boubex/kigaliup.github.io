Hey Fam,

We're back!

We took a brief hiatus in July to plan for our annual festival due in August, which has been postponed and will soon be announced!

That said, we owe it to you Fam to have not one, but TWO spoken word events this month! :-)

Join us for the first one next week Wednesday, 17 August at on the rooftop of Impact Hub Kigali at the spanking Cafe Neo, Kiyovu.

The theme for next week is 'Untold Stories. We can only imagine the powerful poems our amazing poets will share with us on this. :-)

Love & Light,
SWR.
